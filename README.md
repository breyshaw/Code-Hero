# Code-Hero

Code Hero is a fun and dynamic quiz game that sharpens basic javascript knowledge through Zelda-themed battles. 

Play the game [here](https://breyshaw.github.io/Code-Hero/).

Motivation: 
I needed to find a fun and engaging way to review fundamental Javscript objects. I thought a battle structure of the quiz would be an entertaining and challenging way to make sure one knows these fundemental concepts. 

Here is the initial battle wire-frame:

Here is the battle, post styling:

In the image the previous question was 4+4=?
Once the user's answer is submitted, a new question is randomly generated.
